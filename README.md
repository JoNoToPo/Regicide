This is a single player adaptation of the board/ card game Regicide.

To use a combo or an animal companion in the game:

1. Type the index of each card and press enter
   (For instance if you want to play the 0th card and the 5th card type 05 or 50 and press enter, this will play both cards)
2. Cards of the same type can be played together as long as the total value doesn't exceed 10 for instance you can play 4 twos or 2 fives
3. You can play an ace paired with any other card
4. If you play multiple cards the effects of each card will be applied

If for whatever reason you ever want to yield, type 8. To use a Jester type 9.
